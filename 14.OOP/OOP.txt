OOP or Obejcte oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of object

What is a obejct ?
-Obejct are real world entities

How OOPs Help us solve real world problems :
OOP basic goal is to solve real world problem via using real word entities that is object in programming to solve it .

For Example we need to built a car racing game 
-The first thing comes in our mind is different cars and tracks these are all real world entities with different properties 

Like car is a global Name which represents car across all the globe like car can be a BMW,Lambo,Audi or even alto a basic car so instead of making a car again and again in programming language which will act as a template to represet different car

So car can be a class with name as a object so all the names of cars will fall in this template like BMW or audi we can pass that name in car --class object name.

and there functionality will be drive only do we wont have to make different function for different car.


So OOps Helps us translate these real world entities into programing.

OOP:-object oriented programming is a methodologyy or paradigm to design a program using classes and object .It Simplifies the software development and maintenance by providing some concept defined below:

a)Class :Is a user defined data type which defines its properties and its function.Class is the only logical reperesentation of the data.For example Human being is class,the body part of a human being are its properties ,and the action performed by the body part are known as funcion.

The class does not occupy any memory space till the time an object is instantiated.


Object is a run time entity .It is an instance of the class.An object can represent a person,place or any other item.An object can operate on both data members and member function.


class car
{
	String name;---------------------------
	int modelNo.;                         }
	String yearOfManufacture;             }------>class attribute or member function
	String Company;                       }
	String Color;--------------------------

	function accelarate()----------------->class methods 
	{

	}

	function brake()
	{

	}

}
/*Now based on these car class we can make many object which will represnt car company*/

main()
{
	car s1=new car();
	s1.name=alto;
	s1.modelNo.=800;
	s1.yearOfManufacture='2000';
	s1.company="Maruti";
	s1.color='black';

	car s2=new car();
	s2.name=x;
	s2.modelNo.=7;
	s2.yearOfManufacture='2000';
	s2.company="Audi";
	s2.color='black';

	/*So here as we can see we can make different object for class car template which points to 
	different car and company and we can do easily by making just one class instead of defining it for millions of car model and company */
}
