Memory allocation of array
---------------------------

->So how does a array acquire memory and store its
element , lets understand with a example

suppose :- we declare a integer type array

	[int array[]=new int[3];]

now we know the integer datatype take 4 bytes of
memory to store a single integer value

and since our array is of integer datatype and
will store 3 element of integer type so the total
space or memory space require by array will br

4*3 = 12 bytes Now lets see how this 12 bytes of
memory will be allocated to the array and it
element ; this 12 bytes of array will be a continous memory block ,lets see how

int arr[]={item1,item2;item3};

Now each item1 , item2 and item3 will be of integertype so they will take 4 bytes of memory and this 4
bytes of memory will be one after another

1)item1:
[101
[102
[103
[104

Now item2 will be placed just after 104 memory address that is 105

2)item2:
[105
[106
[107
[108

3)item3:
[109
[110
[111
[112


int arr[] address will be the first element starting block address that is 101

int arr[]:

[101|102|103|104|105|106|107|108|109|110|111|112]

this is the memory block of arr array

Starting memory address or refrence memory address of each element is :

item1 : 101
item2 : 105
item3 : 109

so as we can see each is stored in contionous memory block by sepration of 4 bytes 

Now lets see how the memory is allocated in JVM to array
