Types of function in Java are:
There are two types of function in java or basiclly in any progrmming languages 

1.PreDefined Method 
2.User Defined Method


I)PreDefined Method :
-------------------
In Jave , Predefined methods are the method that is already defined in the Java Libraries is known as predifine method it is also as SLM(Standard library method) or bulit in Method.


We can directly use this method just by calling them in the program at any point.Some predefine method are lenght(),equals(),compareTo(),sqrt() etc

When we call any of the predefined method in our program a series of code related to the corresponding method and run in background that is already stored in library.

Each and every predefined method is defined inside a class.Such aas print() method is defined in the java.io.PrintStream

[java.io.PrintStream()] is class that print the statement we write inside the method,For Example print("java") it will print java onto the console.


Example of pre defined function.
----------------------------------

public class Demo
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		System.out.print("The max is:"+Math.max(1,3));
	}
}

The max is : 3

In the above example , we have used 3 pre defined methods 1.main() 2.print() and 3.max(),we have used these 3 method directly without declartion or defining it because they are pre defined in java library
The print() method falls under class PrintStream and the max() method falls under Math class that returns the greater of two number .

We can also see the method signature of any predefined method by using the link [https://docs.oracle.com/] or [https://docs.oracle.com/search/?q=Java&pg=1&size=10&showfirstpage=true&lang=en]

Now when we go through this link and see max() method signature , we find the following .

max:
----
public static int max(int num1 , int num2)
|
|--->returns the greater of two number 

Parameter :
a -- an argument 
b -- an argument 

Returns :
The larger of a and b or greater of and b


In the above method signature , we see that the method signature has a access specifier (public),non-access modifier (static),return type(int),method name max and parmeter list (int num1,int num2).In the above example instead of definig the method we just invoke it that is just call the main method,this advantage of predefined method it makes progaram less complicated.


II)User Defined Method
The method(function) written by the user or programmer is known as a user defined method/function.These methods are modified according to the requirement.

However to create a user define function or method that checks the number of even or odd.First we will define method with access specifier,access modifier(optional),return type and methodm name.


public static void findEvenOrOdd(int num)
{
	//method body
	if(num%2==0)
	{
		System.out.print(num+"Is Even");
	}
	else
	{
		System.out.print(num+"Is Odd");
	}
}

We have defined the above method named findEvenOdd() it has a parameter num of type int.The method does not return any value thats why we have used void .The method body contains the step to check the number even or odd,if the number is even it will print the (number) is even,else print the number is odd.
