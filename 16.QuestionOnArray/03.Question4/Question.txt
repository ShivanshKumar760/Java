Q4.Write a Program to tell if array is sorted or not 

Explanation:
-------------

Lets understand how can we tell this using a example of a array 

arr={5,6,7,10,11};

Now if we see arr-array we can clearly tell that arr is sorted in ascending order ie element are arranged from smaller value to higher value .

and if we see closely we can observe a pattern which can classify weather or not a array is sorted 

So if we look closely in order for array to be sorted arr[i]<arr[i+1]--->and if this returns true it is sorted 


or 
arr[i-1]>arr[i]-->and if this condition give false that also means array is sorted cause that means array previous element is not grater than next element 


Approach:

1.We will take a array
2.we will use a boolean check variable with preset value true 

3.we will iterate array from i=1 to length(array)-1 and we will check :
	arr[i]<arr[i-1]
	{
		check=false;
	}
	 --now why are we doing it like this when we can easily start array
	

	traversing from 0 to length(array)-1 and check if arr[i]<arr[i+1] well cause the flaw is in arr[i+1] cause indexing for array element is till 0 to length -1 and when i is equal to length(Array)-1 and we use arr[i+1] it will show erro index out of bound that's why we use :
	arr[i]<arr[i-1]
	{
		check=false;
	}


4.When arr[i]<arr[i-1] condition will become true we will update the value of check from true to false and break the loop at that point which will indicate that array is not sorted .
