Q3.Write a program to find the element count which are strictly greater than given number "X" in the given array:


Explanation:

arr={1,2,3,4,5,2,1};
and we asked user for a input x let x=3 ,so we need to write a program to count the number of element ,greater than x=3 in array 

so if x=3 and arr={1,2,3,4,5,2,1};

elements greater than 3 will be 4 and 5 ie arr[3] and arr[4]  makes total of 2 element are greater than 3 


Approach :

1)Iterate through array
2)use index from 0 to length -1 and compare it with X such that arr[i]>X
3)when found a element greater than x increment total count
