Java loop is used to iterate over a part of the program or code several time.If the number of iterationn is fixed it is recommended to use for loop

There are three types of loop
i)for loop
-The java for loop is used to iterate over a part of program several times if the number of iteration is fixed , it is recommended to use for loop

-Syntax:
--------
for(initialize_of_iterator;condition;updation_of_iterator)
{
	
}

-types of for loop
a)Simple for loop
b)for-each or enhanced for loop
c)labeled for loop
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ii)while loop
-The java while loop is used to iterate over a peice of code several time . If the number of 
iteration is not fixed and only condition is known we use while loop

Syntax:
-----------

while(condition)
{
	//block of code;
	updation_for_iterator;
}

In loop Updation is necesarrry if not given program will produce infintie loop

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


iii)do-while loop
-----------------
The java do while loop is used to iterate over a part of the program several times.Use it if the number of iteration is unknown or number of iteration is not fixed and if you must have to 
execute the loop at least once.

do
{
	Statement1;
	..
	statementN;

	updation_for_iterator;

}while(condition)

dowhile loop always execute at least once
